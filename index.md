Technical Experience
--------------------

Hobbyist Game Development
    During my summers I have made three games playable to completion and prototyped many more. They can be found here.

    * A chess survival game where enemy pieces fall onto the board. You can capture pieces or convert them to player pieces. When you run out of kings the game is over.
    * A deckbuilding roguelite which attempts to translate action game mechanics into a turn-based game. It takes place in a 3D environment.
    * A Pacman clone with stealth action mechanics added to make it more exciting as well as more complex AI to make the game less predictable for experts.

Programming Languages
    * **C#:** This is the language I have used most since starting programming. The above games I made are written in this language.

    * **Java:** Most of my schoolwork was written in Java.

    * **C & C++:** A lesser but still significant extent of my work was written in these languages.

    * Basic knowledge of **Ruby**
